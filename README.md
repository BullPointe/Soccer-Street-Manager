# Soccer-Street-Manager
My 10th Grade Final Project- A Soccer Manager Simulator.

Manage a Soccer Team and play a entire 16 game season against other teams  :)



----BUGS----
1) Scheduling Conflicts-> HUB.JAVA 
-------> The game runs into errors int that the user team plays itself 
-------> Resolved when the number of games are changed to 3 orginally 4......But 1 game a week is skipped
-------> This results in a messed up league table

:)
