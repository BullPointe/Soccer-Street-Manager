# Soccer-Street-Manager
My 10th Grade Final Project- A Socccer Game Simulator

----BUGS----
1) Scheduling Conflicts-> HUB.JAVA 
-------> The game runs into errors int that the user team plays itself 
-------> Resolved when the number of games are changed to 3 orginally 4......But 1 game a week is skipped
-------> This results in a messed up league table
